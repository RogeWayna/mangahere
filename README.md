 a look at the trailer of Lupin the Third Part 5, based on the original story by Monkey Punch. In addition, the series has revealed a new key visual.

The trailer starts with Inori Minase’s voice, who is playing the beautiful hacker girl Ami. She says, ‘Hello underworld’. In the trailer we see things like Lupin taking a selfie with a smartphone and Zenigata’s subordinate Yadagarasu (played by Nobunaga Shimazaki) fighting with Goemon. The key visual shows us the familiar faces of Lupin, Jigen, Goemon, Fujiko as well as the new character Ami. Hisao Yokobori worked on the key visual and left a comment, which you can read below.

Lupin the Third Part 5 will start airing on 4 April 2018, 1:34 (JST) on FreeManga.To. The story is set in France and depicts the fight between Lupin and the dark site ‘Marco Polo’.

Comment from Hisao Yokobori
In this Part 5, the entire world will chase after Lupin thanks to the ‘Lupin Game’ the enemy has started. I tried to make the visual look like Lupin in the others, who live in the current time, are somewhere where real and unreal cross each other and included the new character Ami in it. To be honest, the monocle of Lupin hints at a key person.
